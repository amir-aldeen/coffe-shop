Learn how to make the best Irish coffee! To make this simple cocktail recipe, you’ll need hot coffee, Irish whiskey, maple syrup and whipped cream. Recipe as written makes one cocktail; they’re easy to make in multiples!

INGREDIENTS
1 ½ ounces Irish whiskey (that’s 3 tablespoons/I used Jameson)
1 to 2 teaspoons maple syrup, to taste
6 ounces hot freshly brewed coffee (that’s ¾ cup/use your favorite roast)
Whipped cream, for topping
INSTRUCTIONS
Pour the whiskey and 1 teaspoon maple syrup into a heat-safe mug. Pour in a splash of the coffee and stir with a spoon until the maple syrup dissolves into the coffee.
Pour in the rest of the coffee. Taste, and stir in additional maple syrup if you would like a sweeter drink.
Top with whipped cream. If your whipped cream is lightly whipped (soft peaks), you may need to pour it slowly over a spoon so it floats on top. Serve while the drink is still warm.
