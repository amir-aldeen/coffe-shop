Ingredients
1 cup coffee
1 1/2 tsp coconut oil
1/2 cup warm coconut milk optional
1/8 tsp cinnamon optional
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper optional
Whole cloves for garnish
Coconut cream for garnish
Star anise for garnish
Instructions
Make a cup of coffee as you normally would and pour into a blender.
Add the coconut oil to the blender and blend for 1-2 minutes until the mixture lightens in color and becomes frothy.
Add any extras you'd like including warm coconut milk, cinnamon and or cayenne pepper and give it a quick blend for 10-20 seconds.
Pour into a mug, top with coconut cream, and grind fresh cloves over the cream, if desired.
Garnish with star anise, and enjoy warm.
Notes
Nutrition: The nutrition label is only for a cup of coffee with the coconut oil, and does not include the coconut milk or any other extras
Storage: If you make extra, you can store any unused coconut oil coffee in the fridge for up to 3 days. Enjoy it cold afterwards or heat it in the microwave.
Tools: I like using the Dash blender and putting it on the soup mode because it warms the drink while blending. You can use any blender of choice though.
