Ingredients
1/3 cup Masa Harina
1 disc Mexican chocolate (3 oz.)
1 cup warm water
2.5 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons brown sugar
pinch of salt
Instructions
Add 1/3 cup Masa Harina to a saucepan along with 1 cup warm water and a pinch of salt.  Whisk vigorously to prevent lumps from forming.
Over medium heat, add 2.5 cups of milk, 1 disc Mexican chocolate, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar.  I usually chop up the chocolate into smaller pieces so it melts faster.
Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain a quiet simmer, whisking frequently.  Once the chocolate has melted take a final taste for seasoning, adding more sugar if you want.  
Keep simmering until you are happy with the consistency.  Serve immediately. 
Notes
It's easy to adjust the consistency of Champurrados.  Simmer them longer to thicken them up, or add a splash of water to thin them out. 
Abuelita and Ibarra are the two most common brands of Mexican chocolate discs.  (More on Mexican Chocolate.)
